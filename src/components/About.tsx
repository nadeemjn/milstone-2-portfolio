         Hello! I’m an IT student currently involved in a program at the Governor House, where I’m gaining hands-on experience in technology and development. I’m passionate about building skills in web development, particularly in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Next.js. I’m dedicated to growing my knowledge and creating projects that bring ideas to life with clean and efficient code.
